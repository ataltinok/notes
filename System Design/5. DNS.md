# Domain Name Service

Servers address each other using their IP addresses. However, the client shouldn't have to know Google's server's IP address to go to google's homepage. That's where DNS comes in.

DNS (Domain Name Service) acts as the phonebook of the internet. When the client asks to go to "google.com", the browser asks a DNS how it can reach that domain. The DNS has mappings from domain names to IP addresses, so it provides the browser google's IP address.

This flow is made possible thanks to your ISP (internet service provider).

## ICANN

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) keeps track every single domain in the world. ICANN is a non-profit organization that keeps track of the domains but does not sell it to developers/businesses. Instead domain registrar's such as *GoDaddy* resell the domains "on behalf" of ICANN.

The resellers have domain servers that provide the **domain name service**.

Also DNS servers have several types of records but for our purposes we need to know A Records (Address records)

## Conclusion

So the actual client to google flow looks like;

Client -> ISP -> ICANN -> Some reseller (GoDaddy) -> GoDaddy's DNS -> A Record that maps google.com to an IP
